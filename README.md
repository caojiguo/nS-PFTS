# Computing codes for the simulation studies and application in the manuscript entitled "Periodicity Learning in Non-stationary Functional Time Series"

Codes for simulation are in the folder named "simulation".

simu_mtfts.R: main procedure for calculating Table 1 in simulation 1

simu_mtfts2.R: main procedure for calculating Table 2 in simulation 2

my.bibasis1.R: calculate the estimators and residual sum of squares

gcvbic.R: find optimal number of knots

Codes and data for real data applications are in the folder named "real data".

The "CO_NOX" folder contains the data of CO and NOX named hkair.csv and the codes.

The "global temperature" folder contains the data of global temperature named global1850.csv and the codes.

The "sunspot" folder contains the data of sunspot named sunspots.csv and the codes.

hkco_s.R: codes for analyzing real data of CO 
hknox_s.R: codes for analyzing real data of NOX 

globaltem.R: codes for analyzing real data of global temperature

sunspots.R: codes for analyzing real data of sunspots numbers 

Two common Functions used in all three applications:

my.bibasis1.R: calculate the estimators and residual sum of squares

gcvbic.R: find optimal number of knots
